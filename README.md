# Student-data-project
Analyzed open-source student data and discovered key insights in relation to scholarships and grants given by universities. Also analyzed age, gender and race of students in these institutions for the past five years. This dashboard provided my stakeholders with a deeper understanding of their demographics, as well as financial opportunities to make better business decisions.
